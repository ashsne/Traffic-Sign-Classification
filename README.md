The goal of this project was  to build a **CNN**  to **classify traffic sign images** from the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset).

Main steps covered in the project are:
- dataset exploration and visualization
- data augmentation
- deep network design and training 
- visualization of the certainty/uncertainty of the model's predictions
